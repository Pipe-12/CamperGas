# Consumption History Modifications - Implementation Summary

## Issue #34: Modificar vista historial de consumo

### Requirements Implemented ✅

1. **Show gas consumption in kilograms for different periods:**
   - ✅ Last day (Último día)
   - ✅ Last week (Última semana) 
   - ✅ Last month (Último mes)
   - ✅ Custom period (Período personalizado) - when user selects start and end dates

2. **Show a consumption chart:**
   - ✅ X-axis: Days
   - ✅ Y-axis: Consumed kg
   - ✅ For user-specified time period

### Files Modified

#### 1. ConsumptionViewModel.kt
- Added `setLastDayFilter()` method
- Enhanced `ConsumptionUiState` with consumption summary fields:
  - `lastDayConsumption: Float`
  - `lastWeekConsumption: Float` 
  - `lastMonthConsumption: Float`
  - `customPeriodConsumption: Float`
  - `chartData: List<ChartDataPoint>`
- Added `loadConsumptionSummaries()` method
- Added `calculateConsumptionForPeriod()` and `calculateConsumptionForDateRange()` methods
- Added `generateChartData()` method for chart visualization

#### 2. ConsumptionScreen.kt
- Added "1 día" filter chip to DateFiltersSection
- Created `ConsumptionSummarySection` composable showing consumption cards
- Created `ConsumptionSummaryItem` composable for individual summary cards
- Added `ConsumptionChartSection` for chart display
- Implemented custom `ConsumptionChart` using Canvas for line chart visualization
- Added necessary imports for drawing (Canvas, Path, Stroke, etc.)

#### 3. ConsumptionChartData.kt (New)
- Created `ChartDataPoint` data class for chart data structure

#### 4. ConsumptionViewModelTest.kt
- Added test for `setLastDayFilter()`
- Added test for consumption summaries calculation
- Added test for chart data generation

### Features Implemented

#### Consumption Summary Section
- Displays consumption in kg for last day, week, month, and custom period
- Clean card-based UI with Material 3 design
- Responsive grid layout
- Shows custom period consumption only when date range is selected

#### Chart Visualization  
- Line chart with data points showing daily consumption
- X-axis represents days in the selected period
- Y-axis represents consumption in kilograms
- Automatic scaling based on data range
- Clean drawing using Compose Canvas
- Only displays when custom date range is selected
- Handles edge cases (single data point, empty data, zero division)

#### Enhanced Date Filters
- Added "1 día" (1 day) filter option
- Maintains existing "7 días" (7 days) and "30 días" (30 days) filters
- Custom date range selection with start/end date pickers

### Technical Implementation

#### Data Flow
1. User selects date filter or custom range
2. ViewModel calculates consumption summaries for all periods
3. ViewModel generates chart data for visualization
4. UI displays summary cards and chart (if custom range selected)

#### Calculation Logic
- Groups consumption data by cylinder and calculates differences between measurements
- Handles multiple cylinders by summing their individual consumptions
- Chart data aggregates daily consumption across all cylinders
- Robust error handling for edge cases

#### UI Components
- Material 3 design principles
- Responsive layout adapting to different screen sizes
- Clean separation of concerns with reusable composables
- Consistent styling with existing app theme

### Testing
- Unit tests for new ViewModel methods
- Tests verify date range setting
- Tests validate summary calculations
- Tests ensure chart data generation

### Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All requirements from Issue #34 have been successfully implemented:
- ✅ Gas consumption display in kg for last day, week, month, and custom periods
- ✅ Chart visualization with days on X-axis and kg on Y-axis
- ✅ Integration with existing date filter system
- ✅ Clean UI implementation
- ✅ Comprehensive testing
